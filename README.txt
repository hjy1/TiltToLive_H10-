Manual:

1.Game Introduction

  The game is Implemented by COMP2012H Group H10.
  This game simulates the Tilt to Live game developed by American studio One Man Left. However, we change the gravity control to mouse and keyboard control and add new features like the merger of red points and unique weapons to make the game moderately difficult and more playable.
  Have fun !


2.How to play

Players can use mouse or keyboard to control the blue point to avoid crushing into the red points to survive as long as possible. At the same time, players can collect weapons to eliminate red points.

Mouse Control: click on the map and the blue point will set destination to that point (click fast to make sure blue point can avoid collision)

Key Control: Use W-A-S-D to control the movement of the blue point.(W-up, S-down, A-left, D-right)

Tool List:
(1) Invince: Blue point becomes invincible and can destroy all the red points that it touches. All the red points will then move far away from the blue point. 
(2) Freeze: Blue point freezes the map so that all red points cannot move for a moment.
(3) Shoot: Blue point equips itself with a gun and shoots to kill red points.
(4) Bomb: Blue point drops some bombs at its location and kills all the surrounding red points.
(5) Explosion: Blue point shoots darts in all directions and kills red points
(6) Swirl: Blue point summons a black hole on the map which will attract all the red points
